# Talks for NodeJS Dublin

Doing my first [NodeJS Dublin](http://nodejsdublin.com) talk - this is the content for the presentation using the slicky reveal.js.

Just in case I get invited back to do another one, I'm intending the split the content up into talk-specific files.

`jun12.html` contains the slides for the Jun 2012 talk

`reveal-examples.html` contains the original reveal.js stuff so that it can be used as a reference.

You can view the presentation [here](http://oisin.github.com/nodejsdublin).
